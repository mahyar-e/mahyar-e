# Hi there 👋

I’m a physics researcher working on **cosmology and gravitational waves**, currently working on the **stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB)**.
I use this space to share research code, notes, and experiments related to theoretical
physics and scientific computing.


## Research Interests
- Stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB)
- Cosmology and early-universe physics
- Statistical field theory
- Gravitational wave data analysis
- Large-scale structure and cosmological perturbation theory
- data analysis
- scientific computing

## Academic & Teaching Experience
- Teaching Assistant — *Elementary Physics I (2 courses), computer programming, statistical mechanics* (Undergraduate level)
- Experience in problem-solving sessions, grading, and concept-driven instruction
- Strong interest in pedagogical clarity and physics education

## Technical Skills
**Programming & Scientific Computing**
- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter)
- LaTeX (academic writing, lecture notes, reports)
- Markdown for technical documentation

**Data Analysis**
- Signal processing and statistical inference
- Visualization of high-dimensional scientific data
- Reproducible research workflows

## Selected Topics & Repositories
This GitHub profile includes repositories related to:
- Cosmology exercises and derivations
- Gravitational wave data analysis tools
- Machine learning applications in physics (CNNs, LSTMs)
- Lecture notes and educational material
- Numerical simulations and visualization scripts

## Philosophy
I value:
- **Clarity over cleverness**
- **Reproducibility in scientific research**
- **Strong theoretical foundations paired with practical computation**
